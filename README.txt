Core Math Library
Vienz Edhrian O. Adaro

The goal was to build a program that can do different math calculations (like Arithmetic, Geometry, and Number Analysis) but organized into different classes instead of one big file.

1. MathOperation (Parent Class)
2. Arithmetic (Sub Class)
3. Geometry (Sub Class)
4. NumberAnalysis (Sub Class)
 
HOW TO RUN IT:
Just run the Main.java file.
