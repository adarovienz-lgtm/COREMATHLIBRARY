Core Math Library
Vienz Edhrian O. Adaro

The goal was to build a program that can do different math calculations (like Arithmetic, Geometry, and Number Analysis) but organized into different classes instead of one big file.

HOW I DESIGNED IT:
I used inheritance to make sure I didn't have to copy-paste code for storing results.

1. MathOperation (Parent Class)
2. Arithmetic (Sub Class)
3. Geometry (Sub Class)
4. NumberAnalysis (Sub Class)
 
HOW TO RUN IT:
Just run the Main.java file.
